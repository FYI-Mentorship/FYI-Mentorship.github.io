# ***Empowering yourself to find your ideal mentor***

## The problem
Early-career scientists, especially undergraduates and graduates, often lack strategies and resources to approach potential mentors, making it difficult to find the right guidance and support for their career paths.

## The goal
Create materials and resources (email templates, checklists, guides) that empower early-career scientists to confidently reach out to mentors, improving their chances of building meaningful mentoring relationships.
