## Call for abstracts
<div>
We will be hosting an on-site poster session in Toronto to feature exciting new work related to drawing & cognition. If you are interested in presenting a poster, please consider submitting an abstract!

We welcome submissions employing approaches from all areas of cognitive science, including psychology, computer science, neuroscience, anthropology, linguistics, & philosophy. Your submission can either take the form of a 150-word text-based abstract OR a 1-page graphical abstract primarily using visual display elements to illustrate your question, approach & key findings.

Two of these submissions will be recognized with $200 “Early Career Researcher Travel Award” intended to defray the cost of either travel or to mitigate other barriers to participation in the workshop/conference (e.g., childcare expenses).

One of these submissions will be recognized with a $200 “Best Poster Award” as judged by an expert panel on workshop day.

Deadline to submit: July 1, 2022 AOE
