Doing my Ph.D. in Biological Sciences, I am specifically interested in promoting diversity, inclusion, and sense of belonging in science education for both students and teachers. I am motivated to work with self-regulated theories along with the role of meta-cognitive learning to study the first-year biology students. I believe the findings are generalizable to many other environments including corporations and institutions.Â
