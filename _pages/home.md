Drawing is a powerful cognitive technology for creating external representations of thought. 
While drawings have long provided inspiration to researchers in many areas of cognitive science, including psychology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience, these communities have not generally had opportunities to interact and share insights. 

This workshop brings together perspectives from multiple disciplines to explore the question of how humans use drawings to communicate knowledge, catalyzing new opportunities for multidisciplinary collaboration. 
Here we introduce a novel "flipped" workshop format.
Join us for 3 virtual seminars in-advance of the <a href="https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci-2022/">CogSci Conference 2022</a>, each highlighting insights from Machine Learning, Neuroscience, and Developmental Science, respectively. 
At the conference, we will host poster session and discussion in-person in Toronto during the conference.

You can view the full workshop description <a href="https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Paper-ID-1270-cogsci22a-sub1270-i10.pdf">here</a>.
