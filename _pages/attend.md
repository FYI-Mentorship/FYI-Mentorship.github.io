<p><h3>Our workshop will host two complementary components:</h3></p>
</div>

<br>

<div>
<p><h5><b>Before the conference</b></h5></p>
</div>

<div>
<p>First, we will host three virtual seminars to introduce each thematic
perspective (Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience, and Developmental Science) in advance of the
Cognitive Science Society Conference 2022. This "flipped" format will be more inclusive,
by allowing attendees to fully participate from anywhere in the world.
Additionally, we will record these seminars so that attendees can also view these
talks asynchronously.</p>

<p>Recordings will become available <a href = "https://images2symbols.github.io/schedule_1/">here</a>.</p>

<p><h5><b>At the conference in Toronto</b></h5></p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Second, we will host an in-person poster session and facilitate group discussion of
issues raised during the thematic seminars on site at the conference in July. These activities
are inherently active and interactive, and will thus empower in-person attendees to
capitalize on this time to interact informally with other researchers (rather than attend
a long series of back-to-back talks). We plan to dedicate the funds allocated to this
workshop to support early career researchers by awarding two student travel grants and one ‘Best Poster
Award.‘ Taken together, we believe our strategy will lay a strong foundation for
further interaction among attendees beyond CogSci2022, and even inspire new multi-disciplinary collaborations.</p>

<p> Stay tuned for more details about our in-person event! A full itinerary will be made available shortly...</p>
