Ultracold atoms are a versatile platform for studying quantum many-body systems. They form "quantum simulators" that can be used to study a wide range of phenomena, from superfluidity to superconductivity. The simulation of these quantum simulators is a challenging task, as it requires the solution of the many-body Schr√∂dinger equation, in a enormous Hilbert space.
