We transform the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method, originally developed for electronic structure calculations, into a general-purpose quantum many-body solver. We have implemented the method in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org) and have demonstrated its capabilities on a variety of systems, including the Bose-Hubbard model and Bose polarons. Our open-source implementation, [Rimu.jl](https://github.com/joachimbrand/Rimu.jl), is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/joachimbrand/Rimu.jl). Contributions are welcome!
